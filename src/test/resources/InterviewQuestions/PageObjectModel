 how do you design pom frame work
   Step-1
   we build two packages such as

		   and loginTests
   Step-2
	   a. in the loginPages package we create a Class call LoginPage
	   and it will work as a Object Repository or provider
	   b. we will design a POM constructor with PageFactoryInitElements
	   and it will build all the instance properties from this class.
